<P align=center><I>Beginnings of Trigonometry</I> 
<P align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trigonometry is an area of mathematics used 
for determining geometric quantities. Its name, first published in 1595 by B. 
Pitiscus, means "the study of trigons (triangles)" in Latin. Ancient Greek 
Mathematicians first used trigonometric functions with the chords of a circle. 
The first to publish these chords in 140 BC was Hipparchus, who is now called 
the founder of trigonometry. In AD 100, Menelaus, another Greek mathematician, 
published six lost books of tables of chords. Ptolemy, a Babylonian, also wrote 
a book of chords. Using chords, Ptolemy knew that

<P align=left>and 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=left>a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sine first appeared in the work of Aryabhata, 
a Hindu. He used the word jya for sine. He also published the first sine tables. 
Brahmagupta, in 628, also published a table of sines for any angle. Jya became 
jiba in translation and jiba became jaib in later writings. Jaib means fold in 
Arabic. This was translated into sinus, or fold in Latin. In 1533, 
Regiomontanus’ published De triangulis omnimodis which dealt with planar 
trigonometry and inverses. Later, Rheticus published Copernicus’ book dealing 
with Trigonometry in Astronomy in 1542. Edmund Gunter first used the 
abbreviation sin in 1624. Sin was first used in a book in 1634. Other variances 
still were popular. Other variances for cosine and tangent were also still very 
popular, especially among different languages. Although sine, cosine, and 
tangent were used very much by astronomers and surveyors, the functions secant 
and cosecant were of little use to these practical minded mathematicians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trigonometry has been used throughout modern 
and ancient history dealing with practical applications, such as surveying. 
Modernly, it has incorporated many other ideas instead of just triangles. The 
six trigonometric functions now known are 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=left>sine (sin) = opposite side/ hypotenuse 
  <P align=left>cosine (cos) = adjacent side/ hypotenuse 
  <P align=left>tangent (tan) = opposite side/ adjacent 
  <P align=left>secant (sec) = hypotenuse/ adjacent side 
  <P align=left>cosecant (cosec) = hypotenuse/ opposite side 
  <P align=left>cotangent (cot) = adjacent side/ opposite side </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left>Three of these ratios are the reverse of other ratios. All of 
these ratios are used widely to determine sides and angles of triangles. Without 
their discovery, surveyors and other practical mathematicians would not be able 
to efficiently determine relationships.
