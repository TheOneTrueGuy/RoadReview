The use of trigonometric functions arises from the early connection between 
mathematics and astronomy. Early work with spherical triangles was as important 
as plane triangles. 
<P><A name=3>The first work on trigonometric functions related to chords of a 
circle. Given a circle of fixed radius, 60 units were often used in early 
calculations, then the problem was to find the length of the chord subtended by 
a given angle. For a circle of unit radius the length of the chord subtended by 
the angle <I>x</I> was 2sin (<I>x</I>/2). The first known table of chords was 
produced by the Greek mathematician <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</A> 
in about 140 BC. Although these tables have not survived, it is claimed that 
twelve books of tables of chords were written by <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</A>. 
This makes <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</A> 
the founder of trigonometry. 
<P><A name=6>The next Greek mathematician to produce a table of chords was <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Menelaus.html">Menelaus</A> 
in about 100 AD. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Menelaus.html">Menelaus</A> 
worked in Rome producing six books of tables of chords which have been lost but 
his work on spherics has survived and is the earliest known work on spherical 
trigonometry. Menelaus proved a property of plane triangles and the 
corresponding spherical triangle property known the <I>regula sex quantitatum.

<P><IMG src="Trigonometric functions_files/MenelausTheorem.gif"> 
<P><A name=9><A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A> 
was the next author of a book of chords, showing the same Babylonian influence 
as <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html">Hipparchus</A>, 
dividing the circle into 360<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif"> and the diameter into 120 
parts. The suggestion here is that he was following earlier practice when the 
approximation 3 for <IMG alt=pi src="Trigonometric functions_files/pi.gif"> was 
used. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A>, 
together with the earlier writers, used a form of the relation sin<SUP>2</SUP> 
<I>x</I> + cos<SUP>2</SUP> <I>x</I> = 1, although of course they did not 
actually use sines and cosines but chords. 
<P>Similarly, in terms of chords rather than sin and cos, <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A> 
knew the formulas 
<BLOCKQUOTE>sin(<I>x</I> + <I>y</I>) = sinx cos <I>y</I> + cosx sin <I>y</I> 
  <P><I>a</I>/sin <I>A</I> = <I>b</I>/sin <I>B</I> = <I>c</I>/sin <I>C</I>. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE><A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A> 
calculated chords by first inscribing regular polygons of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 
sides in a circle. This allowed him to calculate the chord subtended by angles 
of 36<IMG alt=degrees src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">, 72<IMG 
alt=degrees src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">, 60<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">, 90<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif"> and 120<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">. He then found a method of 
finding the cord subtended by half the arc of a known chord and this, together 
with interpolation allowed him to calculate chords with a good degree of 
accuracy. Using these methods <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A> 
found that sin 30' (30' = half of 1<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">) which is the chord of 1<IMG 
alt=degrees src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif"> was, as a number to 
base 60, 0 31' 25". Converted to decimals this is 0.0087268 which is correct to 
6 decimal places, the answer to 7 decimal places being 0.0087265. 
<P><A name=19>The first actual appearance of the sine of an angle appears in the 
work of the Hindus. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aryabhata_I.html">Aryabhata</A>, 
in about 500, gave tables of half chords which now really are sine tables and 
used jya for our sin. This same table was reproduced in the work of <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Brahmagupta.html">Brahmagupta</A> 
(in 628) and detailed method for constructing a table of sines for any angle 
were give by <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Bhaskara_II.html">Bhaskara</A> 
in 1150. 
<P><A name=21>The Arabs worked with sines and cosines and by 980 <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Abu'l-Wafa.html">Abu'l-Wafa</A> 
knew that 
<BLOCKQUOTE>sin 2<I>x</I> = 2 sin <I>x</I> cos <I>x</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>although it 
could have easily have been deduced from <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html">Ptolemy</A>'s 
formula sin(<I>x</I> + <I>y</I>) = sin <I>x</I> cos <I>y</I> + cos <I>x</I> sin 
<I>y</I> with <I>x</I> = <I>y</I>. 
<P><A name=27>The Hindu word <I>jya</I> for the sine was adopted by the Arabs 
who called the sine <I>jiba</I>, a meaningless word with the same sound as 
<I>jya</I>. Now <I>jiba</I> became <I>jaib</I> in later Arab writings and this 
word does have a meaning, namely a 'fold'. When European authors translated the 
Arabic mathematical works into Latin they translated jaib into the word sinus 
meaning fold in Latin. In particular <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fibonacci.html">Fibonacci</A>'s 
use of the term <I>sinus rectus arcus</I> soon encouraged the universal use of 
sine. 
<P><A name=29>Chapters of <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html">Copernicus</A>'s 
book giving all the trigonometry relevant to astronomy was published in 1542 by 
<A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Rheticus.html">Rheticus</A>. 
<A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Rheticus.html">Rheticus</A> 
also produced substantial tables of sines and cosines which were published after 
his death. In 1533 <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Regiomontanus.html">Regiomontanus</A>'s 
work <I>De triangulis omnimodis</I> was published. This contained work on planar 
and spherical trigonometry originally done much earlier in about 1464. The book 
is particularly strong on the sine and its inverse. 
<P><A name=31>The term sine certainly was not accepted straight away as the 
standard notation by all authors. In times when mathematical notation was in 
itself a new idea many used their own notation. Edmund <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gunter.html">Gunter</A> 
was the first to use the abbreviation sin in 1624 in a drawing. The first use of 
sin in a book was in 1634 by the French mathematician <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Herigone.html">Hérigone</A> 
while <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Cavalieri.html">Cavalieri</A> 
used <I>Si</I> and <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Oughtred.html">Oughtred</A> 
<I>S</I>. 
<P>It is perhaps surprising that the second most important trigonometrical 
function during the period we have discussed was the versed sine, a function now 
hardly used at all. The versine is related to the sine by the formula 
<BLOCKQUOTE>versin <I>x</I> = 1 - cos <I>x</I>. </BLOCKQUOTE>It is just the sine 
turned (versed) through 90<IMG alt=degrees 
src="Trigonometric functions_files/degrees.gif">. 
<P><A name=39>The cosine follows a similar course of development in notation as 
the sine. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Viete.html">Viète</A> 
used the term sinus residuae for the cosine, <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gunter.html">Gunter</A> 
(1620) suggested co-sinus. The notation Si.2 was used by <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Cavalieri.html">Cavalieri</A>, 
s co arc by <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Oughtred.html">Oughtred</A> 
and S by <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Wallis.html">Wallis</A>. 

<P><A name=41>Viète knew formulas for sin nx in terms of sin x and cos x. He 
gave explicitly the formulas (due to <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pitiscus.html">Pitiscus</A>) 

<BLOCKQUOTE>sin 3<I>x</I> = 3 cos <SUP>2</SUP><I>x</I> sin <I>x</I> - sin 
  <SUP>3</SUP> <I>x</I> 
  <P>cos 3<I>x</I> = cos <SUP>3</SUP><I>x</I> - 3 sin <SUP>2</SUP><I>x</I> cos 
  <I>x</I>. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=47>The tangent and cotangent came via a 
different route from the chord approach of the sine. These developed together 
and were not at first associated with angles. They became important for 
calculating heights from the length of the shadow that the object cast. The 
length of shadows was also of importance in the sundial. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Thales.html">Thales</A> 
used the lengths of shadows to calculate the heights of pyramids. 
<P><A name=49>The first known tables of shadows were produced by the Arabs 
around 860 and used two measures translated into Latin as <I>umbra recta</I> and 
<I>umbra versa.</I> <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Viete.html">Viète</A> 
used the terms amsinus and prosinus. The name tangent was first used by Thomas 
<A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fincke.html">Fincke</A> 
in 1583. The term cotangens was first used by Edmund <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gunter.html">Gunter</A> 
in 1620. 
<P><A name=51>Abbreviations for the tan and cot followed a similar development 
to those of the sin and cos. <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Cavalieri.html">Cavalieri</A> 
used Ta and Ta.2, <A 
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Oughtred.html">Oughtred</A> 
used <I>t</I> arc and <I>t</I> co arc while Wallis used <I>T</I> and <I>t</I>. 
The common abbreviation used today is tan by we write tan whereas the first 
occurrence of this abbreviation was used by <A
